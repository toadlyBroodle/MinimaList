- Phase 8.1 CRUD-audit prep: guard OutlineTree.m4995b against empty f3987b — search-mode add-new (mo4851al when no row focused + f3898ao != -1) called f3987b.get(0)/get(size-1) without an isEmpty() check, IOOBE when search filter narrows to zero rows; fall back to m4991a((OutlineRow) null) (the non-search root-add path); same shape as bd4b8ac MainActivity.onStop AIOOBE fix; device smoke (Moto G API 30) launches clean, no fatal exceptions; tests 206 → 208 — by sst-dev-cycle at 2026-05-19T03:45Z

- Phase 10 follow-up: prune SettingsFragment cloud-era UI (rate/support/privacy_policy/send_anon_data — 4 buttons + Switch, layout/ + layout-large/ + handlers + 5 strings) + refine 10.3 colors.xml to sage-neutral palette (#7A8471 accent / #4B5358 primary / #2F3438 primary-dark + softened colorTextWhite #F4F4F2 / colorTextWhiteCompleted #A8AAA5 + matched firebaseColor* vestigials); add f3880ap.setBackgroundColor(accent) for Contribute on GitHub button missed by 10.4/10.5; drop dead SublistFragment.onResume m4946k() empty if-block; Phase10ColorsTest hexes refreshed + 5 new Phase10MenuSurfacePruneTest regression guards; tests 182 → 187 — by sst-dev-cycle at 2026-05-19T17:30Z

## Next up (queued for next cycle)

- [hard] 8.1 CRUD: create/edit/delete outline rows; nesting indent works; collapsed-state persists across app restart. Reason: Phase 7 device test passed; Phase 9 Room wiring in place; acceptance testing can now begin.
- [medium] 8.2 Reminders: setting a reminder fires a notification at the scheduled time; rescheduling on device boot works. Reason: depends on 8.1.
- [medium] 8.3 Home-screen widget renders the current list and survives app data update. Reason: depends on 8.1; widget provider verified in Phase 7.
- [medium] 8.4 Drawer / settings / appearance toggles wired to real preferences. Reason: AppSettings and SettingsFragment wiring confirmed in Phase 7 run; acceptance test remaining.
